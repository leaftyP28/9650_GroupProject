Steps to run the 'AK_Code_Combined_Energy-Related CO2 Emissions and Electricity Consumption' python code:

1. Create a folder that you will save this python file and cvs files in. All files need to be saved in the same folder.
2. Download ‘annual_consumption_state’ and ‘Energy Sources Emissions_Combined’ csv files along with the python code, 
‘AK_Code_Combined_Energy-Related CO2 Emissions and Electricity Consumption’, and save them in the newly created folder. 
3. You can run this python file in Spyder or any IDE that supports python codes. If you are using Spyder, open the python file to run it.
4. All you need to do is run the code and it will perform all the analysis using the csv files that you previously saved.
5. Analysis and graphs will be displayed in the console.

Machine learning is teaching the machine to learn from the data. When I say “to learn from data”, I mean, not just understanding the patterns in data, 
but extracting insights from it. These insights further help in making predictions.

Linear regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm. That is the reason why our data has at least two columns where one column maps to the other. 
This means the second column tells the exact values that need to be mapped to first column.

How does a child learn to speak? The parents teach letters, then words. Then the child learns to form 2 words and then whole sentences ... this is like supervised learning. 
The parent is the supervising agent to the child. The child can be understood as the model that learns

Also, when the child is learning, it makes mistakes and learns right? 
This part can be understood as the “optimization” technique used in machine learning. 
Optimization techniques involves gradient descent, hyper parameter tuning and so on.

Electricity consumption

The data is read into a dataframe. 
There are 5 energy resources : coal, other gasses, natural gas, geothermal and petroleum.
We are trying to find the electricity consumed by each of these resources.
In addition to this, we also try to predict the electricity consumed for the upcoming years.
For this, we will use Linear Regression. 
Linear Regression is a Machine Learning algorithm/statistical method that helps extrapolate values for the given data.
A sample dataset for Linear Regression model would contain two columns where one value in one column maps to the corresponding value in the second column. 
This data can be used to train the model. Few values in the first columns would not have a corresponding value in the second column.
These are the values that need to be predicted. For this purpose, the data (which has both the column of values) is trained using scikit-learn. The “linear_model” class is imported from scikit-learn to implement Linear Regression .
This training data is used to extrapolate/predict the values which don't have a corresponding second column-value.
The x value or the first column is the resource and the y value is the electricity consumed (with respect to the graph).

Carbon dioxide emissions

The data is read into a dataframe. 
There are 4 energy resources: coal, electricity, natural gas, and petroleum.
We are trying to find the carbon emissions by each of these resources.
In addition to this, we also try to predict the energy emissions for the upcoming years.
For this, we will use Linear Regression.

To plot the predicted values as a scatter plot, the matplotlib library along with the “scatter” function is used
In this case, our x value or the first column is the "year” column and the y value is the emission value for every resource or the second column
